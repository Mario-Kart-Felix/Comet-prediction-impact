How often do Jupiter and Earth align (I mean, as a transit seen from the sun)?

Planetary alignments can be predicted using a simple formula:

T=P1P2P1&#x2212;P2" role="presentation" style="display: inline-table; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; font-size: 15px; text-indent: 0px; text-align: left; text-transform: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: normal; overflow-wrap: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; position: relative;">T=P1P2P1−P2T=P1P2P1−P2

Jupiter has an orbital period of around 4,330.6 days. Earth’s is 365.24 days. Plugging in to our formula, the planets align once every 398.88 days. That’s about once every 13 months.

However, alignments are one thing, but transits are quite another.

Alignments occur when the two planets and the sun form a line when their orbits are projected on a plane. In other words, if you were looking “down” from above, Jupiter, Earth, and the Sun would appear to be sitting on a straight line.

However, if we treat Earth’s orbit around the sun as “the plane” (this is known as the ecliptic), then Jupiter’s orbit is inclined 1.31° with respect to that orbit. You can think of this as Jupiter’s orbit being “slanted” a bit with respect to the plane of the Earth’s orbit around the sun.

This all boils down to one thing: many alignments will not be transits.

The projected alignments from Jupiter are relatively common, though:

Transits of Earth from Other Planets | Retort

Here is a an example from that site:

June 24, 2055June 29, 2067December 26, 2072July 4, 2079December 31, 2084July 9, 2091January 4, 2097January 10, 2109

As is often the case for these transits, there are overlapping patterns. There is a 2,007 day pattern, as well as a 2,381 day and a 4,388 day pattern. More detailed calculations can be found here:

But, very roughly put, there’s a transit of Earth view-able from Jupiter once or twice a decade, or every 5th, 6th, or 11th orbit, depending on where you are in the cycles.

Not every transit is created equal, either - some involve the Earth moving more or less straight across the surface of the sun, while others will involve more of a grazing.

If, someday, we ever build space telescopes on Ganymede to examine exoplanets, we might use these transits to test the optics!
